## Chromatic3D Project

### Overview
The Chromatic3D project is a Java-based application that visualizes RGB color spaces in a 3D environment. This project was primarily built for my high school chemical experiment needs, making it easier to visualize and read data. It uses the Jzy3d library to create and manipulate 3D charts and shapes.

### Features
- **3D RGB Cube Visualization**: Visualize RGB color spaces in a 3D cube.
- **Experiment Sets**: Add and manage multiple experiment sets with different colors and points.
- **Customizable Display**: Toggle various display options such as background, equations, gravity points, and more.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Generate reports with detailed analysis of experiment sets including polygon area, distance from origin, and brightness percentage.

### Project Structure
- `src/main/java/com/njdge/chromatic3d`: Contains the main application code.
- `src/main/java/com/njdge/chromatic3d/object`: Contains classes related to experiment sets and environment management.
- `src/main/java/com/njdge/chromatic3d/spaces`: Contains demo classes for visualizing RGB spaces.

### Dependence
- [Jzy3d](http://www.jzy3d.org/) - A Java library for 3D plotting.
